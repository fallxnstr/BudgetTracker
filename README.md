# A Budget Tracker App created using Rust & Slint.

## About

Simple app I was developing for the sake of getting familiar with UI design, the Rust language.

## Usage
   1. Open the Main.rs file in the scr\ folder, or open the pre-compiled exe located in target\debug.
   2. Enter the expense or income into the app
   3. Enjoy your balance tracking. The app will remember your last changes.
